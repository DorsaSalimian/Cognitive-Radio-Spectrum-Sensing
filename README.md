# 📡 Cognitive Radio Spectrum Sensing

This project implements an energy detection–based spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio systems using MATLAB. The simulation evaluates the probability of detection (Pd) under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions through extensive Monte Carlo analysis.

The model assumes an AWGN channel and applies a statistically derived detection threshold based on a predefined false alarm probability (Pf). Performance is analyzed by plotting Pd versus SNR, demonstrating the effectiveness and limitations of energy detection in low-SNR environments.

Key features:

  Energy detection spectrum sensing

  Monte Carlo simulation for statistical accuracy

  Pd vs. SNR performance evaluation

  Threshold design based on false alarm probability

  MATLAB implementation suitable for cognitive radio research and education
