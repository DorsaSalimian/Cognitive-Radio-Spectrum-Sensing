# Cognitive-Radio-Spectrum-Sensing
This project implements an energy detection–based spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio systems using MATLAB. The simulation evaluates the probability of detection (Pd) under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions through extensive Monte Carlo analysis.
